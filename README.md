## Project Introduction

We are working on a live chat server that encrypts and stores messages. We want to create a server that will allow users to send messages back and forth and view message history. The server will have also have message security by encrypting and decrypting messages on user devices, so that the central server will not be able to see the plaintext of the messages, and will only be able to see encrypted versions of the messages. We chose to work on this project because we would learn about networking, servers, and encryption while using our Rust skills to make the final product memory safe and efficient.
